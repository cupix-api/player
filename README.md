# Cupix Player API
Cupix Player API allows developers to easily integrate the Cupix Player within native applications by providing a simple way to send and receive events between the embedded Cupix Player and the parent application. For instance, the Cupix Player can be embedded in a web page using an iframe, and the parent window (web page) can listen to its events and also send commands to query data and control its behaviors. 

As well as an iframe on a web page, this bidirectional event messaging is supported on .NET, iOS, and Android applications using a web component like CefSharp (.NET), WKWebView (iOS), or WebVie (Android).
